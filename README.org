A collection of notes on several subjects.

* Principles

  When developing I try to apply the following principles:

** Open
   I prefer open technologies. This means I use open source software (OSS) whenever I can. And practically the only times that I can't involve working together on Microsoft Office documents.

** Don't repeat yourself
   I try to solve everything only once.

** Don't re-invent the wheel

** Use as-is

** Fast-follower

** Design patterns

* My preferred tools:

* [[/posts/emacs][Emacs]] (or sometimes [[https://code.visualstudio.com/][Code]]) for code editing.
* [[/posts/git][Git]] for version management and [[https://github.com/otech-nl][Github]] for sharing my code, issue management, and (Kanban) boards.
* [[/posts/vagrant][Vagrant]] for managing development environments where [[/posts/pipenv][Python's virtual environments]] are not enough.
* [[/posts/org-mode][org-mode]] (and sometimes [[https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax][Markdown]]) for plain text editing.

  Finally, some of my favorite web-sites for tech information:

* [[https://scotch.io/][Scotch.io]] provides some really nice tutorials.

  I prefer to work on Ubuntu, but are sometimes forced to work on Windows. Therefore all my tools must work on both.
